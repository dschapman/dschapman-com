# About Me

<Avatar />
My name is Daniel Chapman and I am a writer, poet, and all around technology enthusiast
from the Pacific Northwest, currently living and working in Northern Virginia. I
am passionate about making both poetry and technology more accessible to those outside
those fields.

Explore this site for more information about me and my eccentric variety of projects<Marginnote count={1}>Eccentric feels like a strong word, but one of my projects is learning the 1976 text editor - [Emacs](/notes/doom-emacs)</Marginnote>, including my poetry collection &mdash; [Seasons of Thought](/poetry/seasons-of-thought) and my current tech projects.

I love learning and as a firm believer in the liberal arts, I don't think learning should be segmented, so here you'll see my interests represented -- literature, poetry, web development, coding, and whatever else I decide to put on here. Enjoy, I certainly enjoyed making it!
