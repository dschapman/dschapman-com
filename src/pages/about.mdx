# About Me

<Avatar />

My name is Daniel Chapman and I am a writer, poet, and all around technology enthusiast
raised in the Pacific Northwest and living in Virginia. I
am passionate about making both poetry and technology more accessible to those outside
those fields.

Explore this site for more information about me and my eccentric variety of projects<Marginnote count={1}>Eccentric feels like a strong word, but one of my projects is learning the 1976 text editor - [[tool.emacs|Emacs]]</Marginnote>, including my poetry collection &mdash; [Seasons of Thought](/poetry/seasons-of-thought) and my current tech projects.

I love learning and as a firm believer in the liberal arts, I don't think learning should be segmented, so here you'll see my interests represented -- literature, poetry, web development, coding, and whatever else I decide to put on here. Enjoy, I certainly enjoyed making it!

# About This Website

This website currently has three different types of content -- [articles](/articles), [poems](/poetry), and [notes](/notes) -- but the unifying metaphor is one of a digital garden, a place where content grows and develops over time, is interconnected and where content is presented in organic as well as manicured ways.<Marginnote count={2}>For more on digital gardens [[web.digital-garden|check out my note]].</Marginnote>

In order to help distinguish the different types of links on this website I have styled links in three different ways. [Internal links](/) are underlined in blue, while [links to my notes](/notes) are highlighted, and [external links](https://wikipedia.org) are distinguished by red underlines.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website. If you're curious about how this website was built make sure to check out [how I coded this website](/articles/how-i-coded-this-website) or [the source code](https://github.com/dschapman/PersonalBlog).
