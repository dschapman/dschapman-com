# I'm Daniel -- Poet, Writer, and Tech Tinkerer

What do poetry and technology have in common? They both sound like gibberish to anyone on the outside.

But poetry and technology don't have to be gibberish; they can each be elegant and powerful tools and companions for every-day life. As someone on the border of technology and the humanities I am passionate about making both technology and poetry more accessible.

This site is a [digital garden](/notes/digital-garden), meaning that it is an organic space that is meant to be explored as I work and tend it.

Here you'll find longer form [articles](/articles) and [poems](/poetry) as well as my raw [notes](/notes).
