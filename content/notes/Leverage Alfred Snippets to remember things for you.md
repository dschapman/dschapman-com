title: 'Leverage Alfred Snippets to remember things for you'

Tags: [[Tools]] [[Alfred]]

Instead of remembering all the letters of a link, or looking up a link whenever I need it, I’m starting to use [Alfred Snippets](https://www.alfredapp.com/extras/snippets/).

Instead of remembering my GitHub url or my book’s amazon link I can simply type `d.book` and Alfred will replace it with my full URL.

For my job I frequently manage a Wordpress website and frequently update specific posts. Instead of navigating to that specific post I can type a short link that will get expanded out to the exact link to edit the post.

## To Do

- Create a snippet to jump start my notes on [[bear]]
