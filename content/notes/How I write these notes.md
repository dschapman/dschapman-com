I used to write almost all of my notes using [[bear]]. The great thing about this is was its ability to easily export to markdown and its gorgeous ui design. However [[Ian Jones]] and [[Zac Jones]] recently introduced me to [[Org-Roam]] and [[Doom Emacs]]. This allows me all the power and flexibility of Emacs and [[Org-Mode]] and some of the best features of [[Roam Research]]. This does come at the cost of a beautiful mobile app, but I can still capture my notes on mobile using Bear and export them to my Org-Roam folder.

I also recently discovered [[md-roam]] an extension of org-roam that allows you to have a markdown folder of roam notes. I have successfully synced this with the content/notes folder of my [[gatsby-theme-brain]] on this website to allow my public notes to be easily accessed and updated live in Emacs.

My private notes are fully featured Org-Mode at the moment, but this public notes can be easily browsed and edited on my local machine in markdown.

When I read books I still prefer to do it with a hard copy that I underline and markup. If the book is particularly impactful I'll do some work to go back and enter my reflections in individual [[book notes]]. Sometimes I do read on my kindle and will highlight passages which I can then copy and paste into markdown notes. *This workflow could use some work*
