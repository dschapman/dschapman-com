title: "How to export Homebrew setup"
---

On [[MacOS]] I use [[Homebrew]] to install most of my files. In order to export your current setup simply run `brew bundle dump` this will export the brew commands necessary to reinstall Homebrew and everything it has installed on another machine.

I was then able to [track this file on Github](https://github.com/dschapman/.dot_files/blob/master/Brewfile) using [this guide](https://www.ianjones.us/2020-05-28-track-your-dotfiles) by [[Ian Jones]]
