👋🏻 Hi, my name is Daniel (D.S. Chapman) and welcome to my notes! This is an experiment in [[learning in public]]. My goal is that my [[website]] be something that I actively use and that I can look things up when I'm working on writing and consult from any device at any time. I also think there might be value in [[networked thinking]] -- that thoughts are powerful when shared, even if they aren't complete when they are shared.

That being said my thoughts are often incomplete and anything here should be considered a work in progress and should be viewed and used as such. If you want more polished thoughts, check out my [Articles](/articles) or my [book](/poetry/seasons-of-thought).

Here are a couple key topical notes:

- [[Books]]
- [[Writing]]
- [[Website]]

If you're curious, check out [[How I write these notes]]!
