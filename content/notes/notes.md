👋🏻 Hi, my name is Daniel (D.S. Chapman) and welcome to my notes! This is an experiment in [[learning in public]]. My goal is that my [[website]] be something that I use and that I can look things up when I'm working on writing and consult from any device at any time. I also think there might be value in [[networked thinking]]. That thoughts are powerful when shared, even if they aren't complete when they are shared.

That being said my thoughts are often incomplete and should be viewed and used as such. If you want more polished thoughts, check out my [Articles](/articles) or my [book](/poetry/seasons-of-thought).

This is an experiment so if this system doesn't work it can be refined or discarded. Here are a couple of central notes:

- [[Books]]
- [[Poetry]]

If you're curious, check out [[How I write these notes]]!
