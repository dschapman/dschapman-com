title: 'Haiku'

Haiku is perhaps one of the most well known forms of [[poetry]] and one that most people have probably tried their hand at in elementary school.

When I wrote a poem every day, I wrote a couple haiku and I also got book of haikus to read. In the introduction to this book (Classic Haiku, editor Tom Lowenstein) I realized that the power and charm of haiku is that they are trying to capture a sliver of time. The present tense. Not the moment before or after but the very instant of writing. That is why classic haikus are so often seasonal and in nature. They are trying to capture time at its most fundamental unit.
