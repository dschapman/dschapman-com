**Notes on:**[Inflammation of the Heart - Curt Thompson MD](https://curtthompsonmd.com/inflammation-of-the-heart/)

“Just as the inflammatory response of the body mobilizes in the same way whether you have a minor abrasion, a sprained ankle or a life-threatening infection, so will our grief emerge unbidden and progress, albeit often subtly and not in a neat, linear fashion, through the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. “

“**This is evil’s playground**: inviting us to pretend we don’t really feel what we feel when we compare our circumstances to those of others, and in so doing, judge our own hearts’ longings to be unimportant. This only leads to our minimizing the next loss, and then the next, and on it goes. The problem with this is that we begin to collect an entire library of “small” emotional losses that we keep burying, yet have to burn energy to contain, and then wonder why we’re so tired, irritable, and eventually even depressed, not wanting to get out of bed, unable to find the energy to create beauty and goodness in the places we are dwelling, even if those places aren’t changing much.“

**grief is like a magnet**

“But our brains have a rather predictable habit of taking advantage of the opportunity for healing. In this sense, God will use the grief of the present moment to bring into the light as much of our grief as we are willing to admit. “

> **1.** **Your grief is unique to you.** Don’t compare your grief to that of another. What is important is that you are able to name your emotion such that you don’t end up having to contain it in your nonconscious, only further draining you of your vitality. Remember, in this time our grief can tend to collectively be about many, many things we have lost. Name each and every loss, no matter how small.  
> **2.** **We must name our griefs in order to create the space available to discover joy.** The space taken up by the grief we retain will be unavailable to make room for joy, as we will still be exerting energy containing our affliction. To maximize joy, we must name our grief.  
> **3.** **Create a Lament and Gratitude Journal.** Each day, hand write down at least one thing for which you are aware that you have lost or will lose. Allow yourself to be aware of what you feel. _Then_ add to that one or two things from your day for which you are grateful.  
> **4.** **Share with one to three people the items from your Journal.** This is important to share with others who are able to validate your feeling of sadness, so as to begin the process of being more connected over the very things that have been the source of your grief.  
> **5.** **Do not be surprised if you need to talk about certain losses repeatedly over some extended period of time.** It will require that you have people who will listen to you with patience, and who will be able to point to action items you can eventually take to turn your attention to other things.  
> **6.** **The weight of your grief may be due to losses sustained at other times in your life.** Be open to naming and writing about your losses you discover that have, perhaps, very little to do with COVID-19.  
> **7.** **Be ready to be the listening ear to others in their grief.** But remember, we can’t give what we don’t have. We can only listen to the degree we have been heard. Plan to both tell of your grief and listen to another’s at least two to three times a week.

“Grief, at first and, well, for that matter at any glance, doesn’t seem to be anything but hard and unpleasant. As followers of Jesus, it is important that we remember that Jesus knows grief. And he isn’t afraid of it. He _knows_ of what we speak to him and to others. He knew the grief of the loss of Lazarus. Of the travail of Jerusalem. Of Gethsemane. Of Golgotha. And he welcomes your grief into his presence—and into the presence of others in whom you trust–in order to hear it. To heal it. To transform it to joy. No matter how long it takes.”
