Emacs is a text editor that is highly extensible and has been around for a long time which means that there are really cool packages including [[org-mode]] and [[org-roam]]. I've been using the [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) variant of Emacs as my main way of [[taking notes]].

## Resources
- [I used this guide](https://www.ianjones.us/2020-05-05-doom-emacs) by [[Ian Jones]] to install both Doom Emacs and [[org-roam]]
- [My doom.d configuration files](https://github.com/dschapman/.dot_files/tree/master/.doom.d)
